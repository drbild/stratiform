# stratiform

[DEPRECATED] This library is deprecated. Use something Hashicorp
Terraform instead (although the limited expressiveness of declarative
HCL is a significant step backwards).

Stratiform is a Python library for concisely creating AWS
CloudFormation JSON templates.  Python's expressiveness leads to
simpler and easier-to-read templates than a purley declarative
approach like JSON.


## Install

```pip install stratiform```


## Example

For an example VPC configuration, see the `example/` directory.
